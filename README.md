## 📘 README: Chatbot with Memory

### 🤖 Overview
This is a Streamlit-based chatbot application designed to simulate intelligent conversation with memory. It retains context across interactions and features a **sticky header** that remains fixed at the top of the interface, ensuring a clean and consistent user experience even as chat history grows.

### 🚀 Features
- **Context-Aware Chat**: Remembers previous messages for more natural conversations  
- **Sticky Header**: Title remains fixed at the top while chat history scrolls  
- **Streamlit UI**: Lightweight and interactive frontend  
- **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable with tools like LangChain, EdenAI, or serverless APIs  
- **Customizable Layout**: Modify styles, fonts, and branding with simple tweaks
